# The Quiet Things

---

## I.

The Perihelion Festival happened once every sixteen years, which meant everyone on *Patience for Small Mercies* was determined to make it memorable. Light-sculptors had spent months preparing cascades of color that fell like slow water through the habitat's central axis. Musicians had composed pieces that would take three days to finish. Someone had convinced one of the tertiary Minds to manifest as a flock of golden birds that spelled out poetry in their flight patterns.

Tomas stood near a drink fountain, watching.

He'd already been to the fountain twice without actually getting anything. It wasn't that he was thirsty. It was that standing near the fountain gave him a reason to stand, and standing gave him a reason to be here without having to *do* anything. His friend Hel had dragged him out—"You can't just stay in your studio for another decade, Tomas, it's *becoming a thing people notice*"—and then promptly disappeared into a crowd of old acquaintances.

So: the fountain. The slowly falling light. The golden birds overhead, arranging themselves into what might have been a joke in a language Tomas didn't recognize.

He watched a woman across the plaza adjust the drape of someone's sleeve—a small thing, barely conscious—and thought about how people move when they don't know they're being watched. The thousand tiny adjustments that happen below the level of performance.

"You're looking at her hands."

Tomas turned. A woman stood beside him—hadn't been there a moment ago, or maybe he simply hadn't noticed. Dark hair, sharp eyes, the kind of posture that suggested she found most situations mildly amusing.

"What?"

"Her hands." She nodded toward the woman across the plaza. "You weren't looking at her. You were looking at what her hands were doing. The way she fixes things."

Tomas considered denying it, then didn't. "It's interesting. How people adjust things without thinking about it."

"Most people would have been looking at the light show." The woman gestured upward, where cascades of color were currently spelling out something celebratory in three dimensions. "It cost someone a year's worth of creative focus."

"It's very nice."

"That might be the least enthusiastic endorsement I've ever heard."

"I'm sure it took tremendous effort."

She laughed—a short, surprised sound, like she hadn't expected to. "I'm Veda."

"Tomas."

"What do you do, Tomas, when you're not failing to appreciate spectacular art?"

He hesitated. Not because he was ashamed of his work, but because explaining it usually led to misunderstandings. People heard *experiential pieces* and imagined the light cascades overhead—big, public, impressive. What he actually made was smaller. Harder to describe. "I make... spaces. Compositions you walk through, rather than watch."

"Sensory work?"

"Sometimes. Mostly I'm interested in—" He stopped, suddenly aware he was about to give a much longer answer than the question warranted.

"In what?"

He looked at her. Most people, at this point in the conversation, had already begun scanning the crowd for more interesting options. Veda was watching him like his answer actually mattered.

"The feeling of a place," he said, more quietly. "Not what a space looks like, but what it feels like to be in it. The way certain rooms make you want to stay, and others make you want to leave, and no one can quite articulate why."

Veda tilted her head. "That sounds harder to show off."

"It is."

"Good," she said. "The things worth doing usually are."

Behind them, the golden birds exploded into a shower of harmless sparks, and the crowd applauded. Neither of them turned around.

## II.

She came to his studio for the first time on a whim—"I want to see what spaces feel like when you're making them"—and ended up staying for six hours.

The studio was small, tucked into a residential spar on the habitat's western curve. Morning light came through the window at an angle that Tomas had spent a week adjusting with the room's systems. There was a fabrication alcove, a broad table covered in samples of material, and a corner where half-finished compositions waited in suspension fields like frozen thoughts.

"This isn't what I expected," Veda said, trailing a finger along the edge of the table.

"What did you expect?"

"More equipment, I suppose. More visible complexity." She picked up a small cube of something that looked like solidified fog. "Isn't experiential composition supposed to be technically demanding?"

"The technical part happens here." He tapped the side of his head. "Or in conversation with the fabricators. The actual making is mostly about paying attention."

She set the cube down, carefully, in exactly the place she'd found it. He noticed that. "Show me?"

So he did.

It was an odd thing, to be watched while working. Tomas had always preferred solitude—the focused quiet of making, without the pressure of an audience. But Veda didn't watch like an audience. She watched like someone trying to understand a language.

He was building something new, then—a small space meant to evoke the feeling of remembering something happy. Not a specific memory, but the texture of recollection itself. The warmth that comes before the details resolve.

"You keep adjusting that corner," she said, after he'd tweaked the light temperature for the fourth time.

"It's not quite right."

"It looks the same as before."

"It isn't." He made another adjustment. "Three degrees warmer. See?"

Veda squinted. "Maybe?"

"You won't see it consciously. But you'll feel safer in that corner now. More willing to stay."

She was quiet for a moment. Then: "You're not making art. You're making feelings."

"Is there a difference?"

"I don't know," she admitted. "But I think I like watching you figure it out."

---

She kept coming back.

Not every day—she had her own pursuits, research into something involving pattern recognition in ancient signal noise, which she described with the kind of enthusiasm that made it sound genuinely fascinating even though Tomas understood perhaps a third of the technical details. But often enough that her presence began to feel like part of the studio's architecture.

She brought him tea that she'd learned to grow herself ("The Minds offered to optimize it, but I told them the imperfections were the point"). He showed her the difference between a space that invited and a space that enclosed. She argued with him about whether emotional manipulation through environmental design was ethical ("Of course it's manipulation. All communication is manipulation. The question is whether you're doing it with consent."). He started leaving a particular chair empty, angled toward the light, in case she stopped by.

One evening, deep into the habitat's artificial dusk, she fell asleep in that chair while he worked. He looked up from his composition—a piece about the moment before rain—and saw her curled there, face soft, the sharp edges of her usual expression dissolved into something unguarded.

He didn't wake her. He lowered the lights incrementally, adjusted the ambient temperature by half a degree, and kept working in the quiet.

Later, she would tell him that was the moment she knew.

He wouldn't find out about that for a while yet.

---

## III.

The idea came from Hel, which should have been his first warning.

"A year," Hel said, spreading their hands like this was an announcement. "You've been together a year, and what have you made her?"

They were in a café that extended improbably from the habitat's outer shell, its windows looking out on the gentle curve of stars. Tomas considered his drink. "I don't think she wants me to make her anything."

"Everyone wants to be made something. It's romantic. It's *meaningful*." Hel's gaze drifted toward the window, going soft for a moment. "When Dara composed that light-symphony for me—the one that filled the whole arboretum—I couldn't speak for an hour. That's when I knew they really saw me. That they'd put in the *effort*." They turned back to Tomas, earnest. "You're an artist—"

"I'm not—"

"—you make literal feelings, Tomas, and you're telling me you haven't composed a single piece for the woman you love?"

Tomas had no good answer for this. The truth was complicated: that his best work happened without intention, that trying to make something *for* someone felt different than letting something emerge, that every time he'd sat down to compose specifically for Veda, the result had felt forced and strange.

But Hel was looking at him with the particular expression that meant they weren't going to let this go, and somewhere in the back of Tomas's mind, a small voice wondered if maybe they were right. Maybe this was what she was waiting for. Maybe his hesitation looked like indifference.

"Something small," he said finally. "Maybe."

Hel smiled. "Something spectacular."

---

He started working on it in secret.

A separate studio, borrowed from a friend who was traveling between orbitals. He told Veda he was consulting on a restoration project—not entirely a lie; he *had* agreed to look at some decaying environmental compositions in the habitat's older sections—and spent his evenings alone with the fabricators.

The piece grew.

He'd intended something intimate, a private space just for her. But intimacy, it turned out, was hard to capture when you were trying. The composition kept expanding, reaching for something he couldn't quite articulate, as if the size of it might compensate for the emotional precision he couldn't achieve.

He added sensory layers—scent, temperature, the pressure of air against skin. He built in references to their conversations, to private jokes, to moments he'd collected and saved. The fabricators hummed through the night, turning his intentions into something vast and intricate.

Somewhere along the way, he lost track of what he was actually making.

By the time he finished, a month later, it filled an entire exhibition space. It was beautiful. It was technically flawless. The habitat's Arts Collective had heard about it somehow—Hel, probably—and offered to host an unveiling.

Tomas said yes before he could think better of it.

---

## IV.

The exhibition space filled with people.

Tomas stood near the entrance, watching them filter in—artists, enthusiasts, curious passersby, the usual crowd that gathered for creative unveilings on the orbital. The space itself was dark, waiting. He'd programmed it to activate when Veda arrived.

She came through the door looking puzzled. He'd been vague about the invitation, calling it a surprise, and now he could see her scanning the crowd, trying to understand what kind of event this was.

Their eyes met. He smiled, nervous, and gestured toward the exhibition space.

"You made something," she said, not quite a question.

"For you."

Something flickered across her face—surprise, he thought, or maybe concern—but before he could parse it, Hel appeared at his elbow, beaming.

"Ready? Everyone's here. The Collective is very excited." They squeezed his shoulder. "This is going to be wonderful."

The lights in the main space dimmed. Tomas led Veda forward, aware of the crowd pressing in behind them, aware of the whispers and anticipation. This wasn't what he'd planned. He'd imagined the two of them, alone, discovering the piece together. But somehow the event had grown, attracted attention, become a *thing*.

He squeezed her hand. "Just... walk through it. I'll explain after."

The piece activated.

It was, objectively, breathtaking.

Light and sound and sensation unfolded around them like a story. The references were all there—the quality of morning in his studio, the exact warmth of the chair where she'd slept, the particular angle of stars through the café window. He'd captured a year of moments, distilled them, made them tangible.

People murmured in appreciation. Someone actually gasped.

Veda walked through it all in silence.

He watched her face, trying to read her expression as the piece built toward its climax—a recreation of the festival where they'd met, the light cascades and golden birds rendered in careful detail. It was the most technically demanding thing he'd ever made. The Collective had called it a masterpiece.

Veda stopped walking.

She stood in the center of the festival recreation, surrounded by phantom light, and said nothing.

The silence stretched. The murmurs from the crowd faded. Tomas felt something cold settle in his chest.

"Veda?"

She turned to look at him. Her face was careful, composed, unreadable—the sharp edges he'd learned to love now forming walls he couldn't see past.

"It's beautiful," she said. Her voice was strange. Distant.

"But?"

"No. It's beautiful. You put so much into it." She looked away, back at the false festival lights. "I just... I need to think. Can I have a moment?"

She reached toward him—a small gesture, instinctive—then stopped. Her hand dropped back to her side. And there, in the space between the reaching and the stopping, he saw something flicker across her face. A softening around her eyes. The look people wore when they were searching for gentle words to wrap around a hard truth.

Pity. She pitied him.

The cold in his chest crystallized into certainty.

He'd gotten it wrong. All of it—the spectacle, the public display, the desperate attempt to prove something she'd never asked him to prove. She was being kind, trying to let him down gently, but he could hear the truth underneath her careful words.

"Of course," he said. His voice came out steady, which surprised him. "Take all the time you need. I understand."

"Tomas—"

"It's fine. Really." He stepped back, already calculating the fastest route to the exit. "I should check on the technical systems anyway. I'll... we can talk later."

He didn't wait for her response. The crowd parted for him as he walked toward the door, faces blurring past, and then he was outside, in the corridor, walking faster than was probably dignified.

Behind him, Veda said something. He didn't hear what.

He was already gone.

---

## V.

He left the orbital the next morning.

There was a ship heading toward a research station on the system's edge—a three-week transit, plenty of time to think, far enough that running into anyone seemed unlikely. He messaged the relevant Minds, booked passage, packed a single bag. Then, on impulse, he filed a privacy override—a request to limit his location tracking to essential safety functions only. The Mind acknowledged without comment, though its brief pause felt like disapproval.

His terminal chimed with messages as he walked to the dock. He didn't read them.

One of them was from Veda. He could tell by the sender tag, the familiar pattern of her address. He closed the notification before the preview could load.

*Better this way*, he told himself. A clean break. She'd move on. She'd find someone who didn't require grand gestures explained to him, who understood instinctively what she needed instead of building the wrong thing and hoping it might be enough.

The ship was a passenger liner, elegant and quiet, with observation lounges where he could sit for hours without anyone expecting conversation. He sat. He watched the stars slide past. He didn't work.

Three days out, Hel sent a message: *What the hell, Tomas?*

A week out: *Veda's asking about you. She seems worried, not angry. Talk to her.*

He didn't respond.

On the research station, he found temporary quarters and tried to resume working. The fabricators were unfamiliar, the light was wrong, and everything he made came out hollow and strange. He dismantled each piece before it could fully form.

A message arrived from Veda: *I don't understand. Please tell me what happened.*

He read it four times. He composed six different responses, deleted each one.

What could he say? That he'd spent a month making her a masterpiece and it hadn't been enough? That he'd watched her face in that moment and seen something close to disappointment? The kindest thing was to let her go.

He sent back: *I'm sorry. I think we both know it wasn't working. I hope you find what you're looking for.*

Her response came quickly: *What are you talking about?*

He didn't answer.

Two weeks later, on a supply run to a neighboring station, he saw someone with her posture in a crowded corridor. His heart stopped. He ducked into a side passage, waited for the crowd to pass, emerged only when he was sure she wasn't there.

It hadn't been her. The hair was wrong. The height was wrong.

He went back to his quarters and didn't leave for three days.

---

## VI.

She found him in the station's smallest observation bay.

He'd discovered it by accident—a maintenance space, technically, with a viewport that looked out on nothing in particular. No one came here. The light was dim and steady. He'd started working again, finally, making something small: a composition about the quality of silence in rooms where people used to be.

The door opened.

"The station Mind told me where you were," Veda said. She stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the corridor light. "I asked nicely. Also, Hel cited something called a 'romantic-loss-prevention protocol.' Apparently that's a real thing."

Tomas froze. The half-finished piece flickered in front of him, light and absence held in suspension. "How did you—the transit time alone—"

"I left two days after you did. Faster ship." She stepped into the room, letting the door close behind her. "You're remarkably hard to find when you're trying to disappear. Did you know you routed your messages through three separate relays?"

"I didn't want to—"

"Make it easy for me? Yes. I noticed." She was closer now, near enough that he could see her expression. Not angry, like Hel had said. Something else. Something he couldn't read.

"Veda, you don't have to—"

"Why did you think you lost me?"

The question hung in the dim light of the observation bay. Outside, stars turned slowly in the void, indifferent to human confusion.

"At the unveiling," he said finally. "Your face. You were... you asked for time to think, and I knew—"

"You knew what?"

"That I'd gotten it wrong. The whole thing. I made you this... spectacle, and you were trying to be kind about it, but I could tell." He looked down at his half-finished piece, the quiet little thing about absence. "You wanted something else. Something I couldn't give you. And I thought, better to go now than wait for the conversation where you explain that gently."

Veda was quiet for a long moment.

Then she laughed.

It wasn't cruel—it was startled, almost involuntary, like something had surprised her. She covered her mouth with one hand, shoulders shaking.

"I don't—" Tomas started.

"Tomas." She dropped her hand. Her eyes were bright. "I asked for time to think because I was *overwhelmed*. Not disappointed. Not rejecting you. Just... trying to process the fact that you'd built me an entire world."

"But your face—"

"My face was probably doing something complicated, yes. That happens when someone hands you a declaration of love the size of an exhibition hall." She stepped closer, close enough to touch. "I wasn't unhappy. I was just... I didn't know what to say. I needed five minutes. You gave me three weeks and a system-spanning chase."

He stared at her. "I don't understand."

"Clearly." She reached out and took his hand. Her fingers were warm. "Tomas. The piece was beautiful. Technically perfect. Everyone said so."

"But—"

"But it wasn't what I fell in love with." She squeezed his hand. "I fell in love with watching you work. The small adjustments. The way you notice things. The quiet parts you don't show anyone else." She nodded toward the composition hovering beside them, the little piece about silence and absence. "This. This is what I wanted."

He looked at the half-finished piece. Then at her.

"You came all this way," he said slowly, "because I ran away from a misunderstanding."

"I came all this way because you're an idiot," Veda said. "A talented, sincere, endlessly frustrating idiot who apparently never learned to ask clarifying questions." She smiled, and the sharp edges of her face softened into something fond. "Also because I love you. Obviously. Even when you're making it difficult."

---

## VII.

They stood in the observation bay for a long time, not talking.

At some point, Veda pulled over a storage crate and sat on it. Tomas sat on the floor, back against the wall, close enough that their shoulders nearly touched. The half-finished piece drifted slowly overhead, casting faint patterns on the ceiling.

"So," Veda said eventually. "What happens to the exhibition piece?"

Tomas considered. "I don't know. The Collective was talking about a permanent installation. It seemed... presumptuous to object, given everything."

"It's still beautiful."

"It's still not what you wanted."

"No." She tilted her head, watching the light patterns shift. "But it's a beautiful thing you made while trying to love me correctly. I can appreciate that, even if it missed the mark." She paused. "Also, the temperature thing was nice. The exact warmth of the chair where I fell asleep? That was a good detail."

"You noticed that?"

"I notice things too, Tomas. Just differently."

He laughed—a surprised sound, rusty from disuse. It felt strange in his chest, after weeks of careful blankness.

"I should have asked," he said. "When you went quiet. Instead of assuming."

"Yes."

"I'm not very good at asking."

"I know." She bumped her shoulder against his. "We'll work on it."

Outside, the stars continued their slow rotation. The station hummed quietly around them, life support and gravity systems doing their invisible work. Somewhere, a Mind was probably noting their location, updating some vast internal model of human movement and connection.

"I'm making something about silence," Tomas said after a while. "About the shape that absence leaves in a room."

"I'd like to see it."

"It's not finished."

Veda smiled. "That's the best time to see it."

He turned back to the piece, adjusting a gradient of light—nothing visible, probably, but she'd feel the difference. She watched his hands move, the small precise gestures, the focused quiet of his attention.

This, she thought. This was what she'd chased across a solar system. Not the grand declarations. Not the spectacular unveilings. Just this: a man adjusting light, making rooms that felt like feelings, letting her watch him work.

"Three degrees warmer?" she asked.

He glanced at her, surprised. Then smiled.

"Two and a half," he said. "You were close."

The piece shifted, almost imperceptibly. The air in the observation bay felt just slightly more like home.
