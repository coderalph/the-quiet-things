# Untitled Romcom - Story Notes

## Premise
Boy meets girl in a post-scarcity future. Boy thinks he lost girl with a stupid stunt. After near-misses and confusion, girl comes back wondering how he could have ever thought he lost her.

## Setting
A Culture-like age of abundance:
- Orbital habitat or interconnected habitats
- AI Minds handle infrastructure; humans pursue meaning
- No scarcity, no money - stakes are purely emotional
- People travel freely, change bodies, explore art and connection

## Characters

### Tomas
- Quiet creative type - introverted maker/artist
- Creates experiential pieces: immersive sensory compositions you walk through, inhabit, feel
- Expresses himself better through what he creates than through words
- In a post-scarcity world, he makes things because they matter, not because they sell

### Veda
- Sharp and curious - quick wit, asks unexpected questions
- Hard to impress with flash, but drawn to sincerity and craft
- She noticed him because of *how* he paid attention to things, not what he said
- Finds most people in abundance-world a bit performative; he isn't

## How They Meet
A festival or gathering on the habitat. He's there reluctantly (dragged by a friend). She notices him noticing things - the way light falls, how people move - instead of performing for the crowd. She approaches him with a sharp observation. He responds with something quiet but genuine. Something clicks.

## The Stupid Stunt
*Over-the-top gesture that backfires*

Tomas spends weeks secretly creating an elaborate experiential piece for Veda. He pours everything into it - a whole immersive environment meant to capture what she means to him.

The problem: What Veda loved was watching him *work*. The quiet concentration. His hands adjusting something small. The unguarded moments. She fell for the process, not the spectacle.

He unveils it. It's beautiful, technically perfect. But it feels... performative. Public. The opposite of what drew her to him. She goes quiet, trying to process.

He reads her silence as rejection. Instead of asking, he assumes the worst. He thanks her politely, says he understands, and leaves. Then he *keeps* leaving - switching habitats, not answering messages, convinced he's spared them both an awkward prolonged goodbye.

## The Near-Misses
*How do they almost reconnect before the ending?*

- Friends try to intervene, but he dodges
- They're at the same place at the same time, but he slips away before she sees him
- She sends a message; he assumes it's a polite goodbye and doesn't respond
- She starts looking for him more actively; he keeps moving

## Ending
She finds him. She's puzzled, not angry. "Why would you ever think you lost me?"

## Themes
- Connection in a world without material need
- The comedy of human miscommunication
- Love doesn't require grand gestures

## Scene Structure

### Scene 1: The Festival (Meet-cute)
*~400 words*
- Festival on the orbital - color, light, people performing for each other
- Tomas is there reluctantly, standing apart, watching
- Veda notices him noticing things (the way light catches something, a detail others miss)
- She approaches with a sharp observation - testing him
- He responds simply, genuinely - not trying to impress
- Something clicks. They talk until the festival fades around them.

### Scene 2: Falling (Montage/glimpses)
*~500 words*
- Fragments of their time together
- She watches him work in his studio - this is what she loves
- He's unguarded when creating; she sees the real him
- Small moments: comfortable silences, her sharp humor, his quiet attention
- Establish: this works. This is good.

### Scene 3: The Idea
*~300 words*
- Tomas decides he needs to *show* her how he feels
- Maybe prompted by something - an anniversary? A friend's suggestion?
- He starts building in secret - the biggest thing he's ever made
- Dramatic irony: we know this is a mistake. He thinks it's romantic.

### Scene 4: The Unveiling (The Disaster)
*~500 words*
- The experiential piece is unveiled - public, grand, spectacular
- It's objectively beautiful. Everyone is impressed.
- Veda goes quiet. She's overwhelmed, processing. It's not rejection - it's confusion.
- She doesn't know what to say yet. She needs time.
- Tomas reads her silence. Thanks her politely. Leaves.
- She starts to say something, but he's already gone.

### Scene 5: The Vanishing / Near-Misses
*~400 words*
- Tomas has left. Changed habitats. Isn't answering.
- Veda's messages go unanswered (we might not see them, or we might)
- Maybe one near-miss: she almost finds him, he slips away
- He's convinced he's doing her a favor by not prolonging it
- She's increasingly puzzled, then determined

### Scene 6: Found
*~400 words*
- She finds him. (Maybe she asked a Mind for help. Maybe she just kept looking.)
- He's somewhere quiet, possibly working on something small
- She's not angry. She's genuinely confused.
- "Why would you ever think you lost me?"

### Scene 7: Resolution
*~300 words*
- He explains. She laughs - kindly, not cruelly.
- She tells him what she actually loved: watching him work. The quiet. The real.
- The grand gesture was beautiful, but it wasn't *him*.
- They're okay. More than okay.
- End on a small moment - the opposite of spectacle.
