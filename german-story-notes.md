# German Translation Notes: "Die stillen Dinge"

## Guiding Principles

**1. Meaning and feeling over word-for-word**
Literary translation isn't about swapping each English word for its German equivalent. It's about making a German reader *feel* what an English reader feels. Sometimes that means restructuring sentences entirely or choosing unexpected words that capture the right emotional tone.

**2. Preserve each character's voice**
Tomas is gentle and earnest. Veda is sharp and playful. Hel is warm with a dry edge. Their personalities come through in how they speak German—their word choices, sentence rhythms, even their humor.

**3. Natural German, not "translated" German**
The prose flows like it was written in German originally. This means respecting German sentence structure, using idioms that feel native (not literal translations of English expressions), and avoiding awkward constructions.

**4. Du vs. Sie (informal vs. formal "you")**
All characters use "du" with each other—they're close friends and lovers. This shapes the entire emotional texture of the dialogue.

**5. Handle the sci-fi vocabulary thoughtfully**
Culture-specific concepts receive consistent treatment. Where Iain M. Banks' German translations established conventions, those inform my choices.

**6. Protect the quiet moments**
The story's heart is in its stillness—Veda watching Tomas work, the weight of small gestures. These beats land just as softly in German.

## Specific Translation Decisions

### Title
- **English:** "The Quiet Things"
- **German:** "Die stillen Dinge"
- **Reasoning:** "Still" captures both "quiet" and "still/motionless," which fits the theme of small, unmoving moments mattering more than spectacle.

### Character Names
- **Tomas, Veda, Hel, Dara** — Kept unchanged. These are names in a far-future setting and don't require localization.

### Ship/Habitat Name
- **English:** *Patience for Small Mercies*
- **German:** *Geduld für kleine Gnaden*
- **Reasoning:** Culture ship names are often philosophical or ironic. This translation preserves the gentle, slightly wry tone while sounding natural in German.

### "Mind" (the AI entities)
- **Decision:** Kept as "Mind" (capitalized)
- **Reasoning:** German readers familiar with Banks' Culture novels will recognize this term. It's become standard in German sci-fi fandom. Using "Geist" or "Bewusstsein" would lose the specific Culture flavor.

### "Arts Collective"
- **German:** "Kunstkollektiv"
- **Reasoning:** Direct, natural translation that preserves the communal, post-scarcity feel.

### "romantic-loss-prevention protocol"
- **German:** "Romantik-Verlust-Präventions-Protokoll"
- **Reasoning:** The humor lies in the bureaucratic absurdity. German compound words are perfect for this kind of deadpan comedy.

### "neural lace"
- Not present in this story, so no decision needed.

### Ending: "fin"
- **German:** Kept as "*fin*"
- **Reasoning:** This French literary convention is understood in German and adds a touch of elegance.

## Notable Phrasing Decisions

| English | German | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| "becoming a thing people notice" | "etwas, das den Leuten auffällt" | Captures the social observation without sounding stilted |
| "experiential pieces" | "Erlebniskompositionen" | Compound word that feels appropriately artistic/technical |
| "light-sculptors" | "Lichtkünstler" | More natural than literal "Licht-Bildhauer" |
| "Take all the time you need" | "Nimm dir alle Zeit, die du brauchst" | Warm, natural phrasing |
| "A clean break" | "Ein klarer Schnitt" | German idiom that conveys the same meaning |
| "You're an idiot" | "Du bist ein Idiot" | Kept simple—Veda's directness translates naturally |
| "Two and a half" | "Zweieinhalb" | The quiet precision of the final exchange preserved |

## Tone Calibration

The story moves between:
- **Gentle observation** (Tomas watching hands, adjusting light)
- **Sharp wit** (Veda's teasing, Hel's exasperation)
- **Emotional vulnerability** (the misunderstanding, the chase, the reunion)

Each register required different German textures:
- Observation passages use longer, flowing sentences
- Dialogue stays crisp and natural
- Emotional moments use simpler, more direct language

## Final Note

The heart of this story is the idea that love lives in small attentions, not grand gestures. The German translation aims to honor that by being precise without being showy—just like Tomas's best work.
