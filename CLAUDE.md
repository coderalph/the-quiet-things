# Project Context

## What this is
A short story collaboration with Ralph, a writer (not a coder). This is his first Claude Code project.

## The Story: "The Quiet Things"
A romantic comedy set in a post-scarcity future (Culture-like setting).

**Premise:** Tomas, a quiet artist who creates immersive experiential pieces, falls for Veda, a sharp and curious woman. He tries to impress her with a grand public gesture, misreads her overwhelmed silence as rejection, and flees across the solar system. She chases him down to ask why he ever thought he lost her.

**Theme:** Love doesn't require grand gestures. She fell for him watching him work quietly, not for spectacle.

## Files
- `story-notes.md` - Planning document with characters, structure, scene outlines
- `story-draft.md` - Complete first draft (~3,500 words)
- `story-analysis.md` - Review, analysis, and suggestions for improving the story
- `story-german.md` - German translation: "Die stillen Dinge"
- `german-story-notes.md` - Translation notes, guiding principles, and specific decisions
- `index.html` - GitHub Pages website (landing page for non-technical visitors)
- `story-image.png` - Illustration for the website (generated with Nanobanana)

## Status
Story finalized. German translation complete.

### Revision history
Second draft implemented four changes from story-analysis.md:
1. Added a beat before Tomas flees where he misreads Veda's gesture and expression as pity
2. Gave Hel a backstory (Dara's light-symphony) so their advice comes from genuine experience
3. Added Tomas filing a privacy override to limit tracking when he leaves
4. Replaced "Hel yelled at it" with a "romantic-loss-prevention protocol" for Culture consistency

### German translation
Translated for Ralph's friend in Germany. Key decisions documented in german-story-notes.md, including:
- Title: "Die stillen Dinge" (captures both "quiet" and "still")
- Ship name: *Geduld für kleine Gnaden*
- Kept "Mind" untranslated for Culture fans
- All characters use informal "du" with each other
